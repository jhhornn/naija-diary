### Explanation of Some Fields
- owner: the author of the blog that is used to query by author.
- readCount: the number of times the blog was visited.
- readTime: time taken to read the blog. The algorithm used is shown below:
```
200 words = 1 minute
1 word = 1/200 minute
(title + description + body) = total words
total words will take `total words / 200 minutes`
```
- tags: these are various categories the blog falls under. e.g #entertainment, #sports etc.
